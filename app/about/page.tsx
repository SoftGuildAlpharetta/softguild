        <p className="has-medium-font-size">
          SoftGuild is a professional development framework with three main
          benefactors. First, community members are introduced to professionals
          who teach what it takes to succeed in their profession. Second,
          professionals are able to network with other professionals in their
          field as they teach and build up their communities. Finally,
          businesses and non-profits gain access to an expanded talent pool and
          are able to build up their communities by offering scholarship,
          internships, and/or apprenticeships.
